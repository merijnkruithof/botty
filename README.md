# Pegasus
Pegasus gives you the ability to load test your or someone else's retro hotel.

Pegasus is a high-performance server with a low memory footprint. It should be able to spawn thousands of bots, even
if your resources are limited. Pegasus can be run on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) or a dedicated server. 
It's not a standalone application, but rather a server application that should be reached from an external address.
