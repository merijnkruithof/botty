# Pegasus
Pegasus is a Habbo load tester. It's able to spawn many bots concurrently.

Roadmap:
- [X] Authentication
- [X] Ping pong
- [ ] API call to add additional auth tickets
- [ ] Adding auth tickets through the API
- [X] Enter rooms
- [ ] Updating look
- [ ] Sending friend requests
- [ ] Creating rooms
- [ ] Divide and conquer (create rooms & spawn bots to it)
- [ ] Proxy support

### Usage
Download pegcli (https://github.com/nji-rem/pegcli) and compile it with the
Go compiler. Clone this repository as well and compile it with the Rust compiler.

There'll be binaries available for Mac (Intel and Sillicon), Windows, and Linux after I finish the roadmap.
